# Stock Price Predictor using LSTM

A deep learning project that predicts future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on historical stock price data to learn patterns and make time-series predictions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features
- Uses LSTM neural networks for sequence prediction
- Supports training on any stock's historical data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance)
- Data preprocessing with scaling and windowing
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Graphical visualization of predictions vs actual prices
